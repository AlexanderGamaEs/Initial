How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Because we need know what is the new line of codes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The mainly issue about this is that maybe you forget commit your changes.
It's better a automatically saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is oriented to programmers and google docs is more like a rich-text editor

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can find the problematica code line

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I going to work in Joiin.mx
